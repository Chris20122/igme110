    <h2>
         The three projects on this website include my research paper on the cultural impact on indie games, my photoshop project, and my senior thesis on esports in schools. You can view the pages that highlight each of the projects by clicking on the links at the top of the page. All of these projects hold significance to me, and I hope that this can inspire anyone else in trying to do their own work! </h2>
