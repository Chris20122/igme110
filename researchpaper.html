     In my research paper, I go over in detail how independent games - or otherwise known as indie games- have a signficant impact on the game industry in cultural and economic ways. Through various examples of indie games that have proven to make a difference, their importance can truly be seen. Overall, I enjoyed this research project as I am personally interested in not only video games, but indie games and their meaning as well. In addition, after viewing different examples of impacts made, I feel inspired in knowing that anyone can be successful if they work hard for it and never give up, just as certain indie developers had done so in the past. Truly, this was a great project that has made me aware of the impacts from indie games today.
