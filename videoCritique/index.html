            <li>This video was made as with the goal to make an example advertisement for a keyboard and mouse. To do so I used two clips to make one of the keyboards look better by comparison. I also used text to promote/ demote the keyboards, and cut between the keybaord clips for a back and forth approach. I also used sound effects and music during the keyboard I was promoting to make it seem more lively. Overall, the critique process only somewhat effected the final version, which lead to changes in text transitions and in different text locations. With this, my advertisement was improved upon by having text transition in certain instance to show more effort was made in making the video. My overall critique from my group members was to address the text (make it easier read), and add transitions to it. They also said to maybe add one more video clip to the advertisement, but I personally felt that what I had done already was sufficient. </li>
