<a>For my senior thesis in highschool, my group and I conducted interviews with teachers and highschool students to show how esports is becoming more prevelant in schools today. In addition, we worked on a reaerch paper and found many sources showing how esports is truly changing for the future, and has educational value and oppurtunity for students. Then, based on our research, our group created a small documentary on what we had learned. I felt that it was one of the most important projects in highschool. It was important to me since I had been a part of the esports club at my highschool, and knew that esports were becoming a much more significant then they were in the past. I can truly say this project taught me a lot about how esports can be beneficial to students today, and how important is is to accept new cultural values as society changes.
